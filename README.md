    '<i class="bx bx-dollar"></i>',
    '<i class="bx bx-euro"></i>',
    ...
  ];
  ```
- Adjust scrolling speed or behavior in the CSS file (`styles.css`):
  ```css
  @keyframes slide {
    from {
      transform: translateX(0);
    }
    to {
      transform: translateX(-50%);
    }
  }
  ```

### Chatbot
- Update bot response logic in `script.js`:
  ```javascript
  setTimeout(() => addMessage(`Your bot response`, "chat-message-received"), 1000);
  ```
